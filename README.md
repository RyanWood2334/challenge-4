# Challenge-4

## Description

This website is a fully responsive quiz!! it uses CSS and HTML for the display, and javascript to take user input and display different questions on the DOM. This quiz uses all sorts of functions to display and mutate the DOM to show different questions, tell the user if they are right or wrong, and then store their scores and initials in local storage. I found it very difficult to keep my code streamlined - I felt like I was building 18 functions to effect one little thing, so I'm really excited to learn and practice being more efficient in using javascript for web apps in the future.
